Class set, get function, class functions
* drew classes graph- called UML patterns
* constructor-ctor (בנאי):
  * =init function = a dander function:
  ```
  def __init__(self,_brand):
    self.brand=_brand
  ```
  * if we don't write it, when creating object from a class, 
  the python will run the ctor with nothing in it, as default.
  * to force create object with limited attributes, will send to the 
  * self i talk about the current object and only on it, the changes will be change only on this object
    * = this in other languages
